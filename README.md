## A crash course on data handling in R, the tidyverse way &#x1F4A5;

-----

## About

#### Welcome &#x1F44B;&#x1F3FD;&#x1F44B;&#x1F3FD;

If you often do data analysis, are enthusiastic about open science and want to improve your skills in R, this course is for you! 

During this 90' workshop, we will have a hands-on experience on handling data using the [*tidyverse*](https://www.tidyverse.org/) packages. We will go from raw and untidy data to a dataset that sparks joy and is ready to be plotted and analysed.

## Goals


During the session you will learn:

- What is the Tidyverse and differences with base R

- How to clean and transform your data with `dplyr`

- How to use the pipe `%>%` operator

- What is tidy data and how to make your raw data tidy &#x2728;

- The ggplot grammar &#x1F4C8;&#x1F4CA;
